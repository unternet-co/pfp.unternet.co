    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>We're on the path to a new kind of web, with an uncertain future: AI-based user agents are now a core interface to the internet for over half-a-billion active users.</p>

    <p>This shift comes as platforms have increasingly seized control of the publisher-reader relationship: search engines are squeezing out web publishers to juice ad revenue, while social platforms have captured audiences with algorithmic reach and paid promotion.
      
      <p>The rise of new AI super-apps, in place of traditional browsers, is set to make this dynamic exponentially worse.</p>
      
      <p>How can publishers engage in this platform shift beyond being a dataset to be scraped? How can we avoid being trapped by a new wave of mega-platforms? And how can publishers on the web reach real users, build lasting relationships, and continue to have a equitable business model?</p>

      <p>
        <mark class="highlight">We believe now is a critical time to get technologists & publishers working together to explore&mdash;and define&mdash;real answers to these questions.</mark>
      </p>

    <h2>What & when?</h2>

    <p>We're hosting a talk night followed by an in-person summit on at Betaworks in NYC, where we'll focus on how we can preserve an open, equitable web, where no one company holds the keys.</p>
      
    <h3>Talk night (August 21st)</h3>
    <p>An evening of presentations and open discussion, where protocol builders and publishers share the latest ideas over drinks and light bites. You'll hear a discussion about the challenges & opportunities in this space, updates on protocols like MCP, Web Applets, AT Protocol, and Web Payments, then jump into an audience-driven Q&A. Wrap up by mingling with speakers and peers in a relaxed mixer.</p>

    <h3>One-day forum (invite-only, August 22nd)</h3>
    
    <p>Join us in New York City for a full day of hands-on collaboration and focused conversations. We'll rotate through small-group discussions on real-world challenges, witness peer-led demos of protocol integrations, and spend dedicated “sandbox time” experimenting with tools and workflows. Whether you're troubleshooting an implementation or brainstorming new agentic use cases, you'll find plenty of opportunities to connect, learn, and build together.</p>

    <h3>Community group</h3>
  
    <p>Stay connected long after the summit, and be at ground level for the next event. Alongside the summit, we'll be  kickstarting a private community where participants will have access to resources, peer check ins, a guided hackathon, and direct support for protocol questions and troubleshooting.</p>

    <h2>Who's behind this?</h2>

    <p>The Protocols for Publishers workshop is being organized by <a href="https://unternet.co">Unternet</a>, alongside some friends from the world of internet protocols. Unternet is developing <a href="https://unternet.co/docs/web-applets/introduction">Web Applets</a>, an open protocol for intelligent software on the web.</p>
