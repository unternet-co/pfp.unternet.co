    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>We're on the path to a new kind of web, with an uncertain future. AI-based user agents are now a core interface to the internet for over half-a-billion active users.</p>

    <p>This shift comes as platforms have increasingly seized control of the publisher-reader relationship: search engines broke their social contract with users by prioritizing ads over quality results, while social platforms have created walled gardens with algorithmic reach controlled by paid promotion. The rise of AI platforms could make these problems exponentially worse.</p>
      
      <p>For publishers, this raises critical questions: how can they engage as publishers, not a dataset to be scraped? How can they avoid being trapped by a new wave of mega-platforms? And how can they reach real users, build lasting relationships, and continue to have a equitable business model?</p>

      <p>
        <mark class="highlight">We believe the answer lies in technologists & publishers working together to explore & define the technology they want, instead of allowing others to dictate it for them.</mark>
      </p>

    <h2>What & when?</h2>

    <h3>Summit</h3>

    <p>We're hosting an in-person summit on the <strong>21st of August</strong> at Betaworks in NYC, where we'll focus on a series of protocols, with each talk presenteded by builders &amp; experts in the field:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>MCP</li>
        <li>Web Applets</li>
        <li>AT Protocol</li>
        <li>Web Payments</li>
      </ul>
      
    <p>Alongside the summit, we'll be  kickstarting a private community where participants will have access to resources, peer check ins, a guided hackathon, and direct support for protocol questions and troubleshooting.</p>

    <h2>Who's behind this?</h2>

    <p>The Protocols for Publishers workshop is being organized by <a href="https://unternet.co">Unternet</a>, alongside some friends from the world of internet protocols. Unternet is developing <a href="https://unternet.co/docs/web-applets/introduction">Web Applets</a>, an open protocol for intelligent software on the web.</p>
