      <h1>Protocols for Publishers</h1>
      <p class="hero-text">
      <strong>Protocols for Publishers</strong> is a virtual hackathon &amp; workshop series that brings together publishers, developers, and researchers to explore open protocols for a sustainable agentic web.</p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>We're on the path to a new kind of web, with an uncertain future: AI-based user agents are now a core interface to the internet for over half-a-billion active users.</p>

    <p>This shift comes as platforms have increasingly seized control of the publisher-reader relationship: search engines are squeezing out web publishers to juice ad revenue, while social platforms have captured audiences with algorithmic reach and paid promotion.
      
      <p>The rise of new AI super-apps, in place of traditional browsers, is set to make this dynamic exponentially worse.</p>
      
      <p>How can publishers engage in this platform shift beyond being a dataset to be scraped? How can we avoid being trapped by a new wave of mega-platforms? And how can publishers on the web reach real users, build lasting relationships, and continue to have a equitable business model?</p>

      <p>
        <mark class="highlight">We believe now is a critical time to get technologists & publishers working together to explore&mdash;and define&mdash;real answers to these questions.</mark>
      </p>

    <h2>What & when?</h2>

    <p>We're hosting a talk night followed by an in-person summit on at Betaworks in NYC, where we'll focus on how we can preserve an open, equitable web, where no one company holds the keys.</p>
      
    <h3>Talk night (August 20th)</h3>
    <p>Join us in New York City for an evening of presentations and open discussion, where protocol builders and publishers share their thinking about the future of the web. You'll hear a discussion about the challenges & opportunities in this space, updates on protocols like MCP, Web Applets, AT Protocol, and Web Payments, then jump into an audience-driven Q&A. Followed by a relaxed mixer with speakers and peers over drinks & light bites.</p>

    <h3>One-day forum (invite-only, August 21st)</h3>
    
    <p>An invite-only full day of hands-on workshops and focused conversations. We'll rotate through small-group discussions on real-world challenges, witness peer-led demos of protocol integrations, and spend time experimenting with tools. This will be an opportunity to explore real problems and opportunities, and lead to collaborations for future community work.</p>

    <h3>Community group</h3>
  
    <p>Following the summit, we'll be  kickstarting a members community where participants will have access to expertise, resources, peer check ins, a future hackathon, and direct support for protocol questions and troubleshooting.</p>
